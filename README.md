# üõ°Ô∏è Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This project is a **machine learning-based fraud detection system** built using Python and scikit-learn. It predicts the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent based on various input features such as transaction amount, location, age, and merchant information.

## üìå Overview

Credit card fraud is a growing problem in the financial sector. This project demonstrates the use of **Gradient Boosting Classifier** and **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to build a reliable model capable of identifying potentially fraudulent transactions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Loads and preprocesses credit card transaction data
- Performs feature engineering (e.g., age calculation from DOB)
- One-hot encodes categorical variables
- Scales numeric features using `StandardScaler`
- Balances the dataset using `SMOTE`
- Trains a **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- Evaluates the model with **ROC AUC Score** and **Classification Report**
- Provides an **interactive CLI interface** for real-time transaction testing

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used is named `fraud.csv`. You can take the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/. 
It should include features like:
- Transaction details: `amt`, `lat`, `long`, `city_pop`, `trans_date_trans_time`, `merchant`, `category`, `merch_lat`, `merch_long`, etc.
  
- User demographics: `first`, `last`, `dob`, `gender`, `job`, `state`, etc.
  
- Target label: `is_fraud`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Please ensure this dataset is available in the project directory before running the code.

## üß™ Model Performance

After training the model on 10,000 sampled records:
- Balanced using SMOTE to handle class imbalance
- Evaluated using test set with:
  - **Classification Report** (precision, recall, f1-score)
  - **ROC AUC Score**
